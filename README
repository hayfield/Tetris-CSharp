A game of Tetris developed quickly as a WinForms application to prove that it is possible to do so.

Allows custom blocksets. These are stored in files with a .blockset extension in the same directory as the application is being run from.
Blocks must be square, with an even length side.
Solid parts of a block are specified by a hash (#), while a blank may be any other character.
There must be at least 1 blank line between two blocks.
There must be at least 2 blank lines at the end of the file.
